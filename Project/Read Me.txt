Known issues:
No sign up page
No validation - will cause uncaught exceptions particularly in the booking form for staff members to add a booking which expects a time format HH:MM (we had planned to change this to dropdown lists)
If a customer tries to edit their details they do not save correctly (for some reason it reads the previous value out of the form not the new one)
Will accecpt bookings in the past
